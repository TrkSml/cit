### Description:
Cit is a small issue tracker that can be included in your project's base directory. It can thus be versioned with the rest of your code using tools like git or bzr. Cit is written in python and resides in a sqlite database.

### Getting started:

    cit init                      # To initialize the issue tracker

    cit add "First issue"         # To add an issue

    cit + 0                       # To upvote issue no. 0
